Hi, I'm a senior undergraduate student at Nanjing Agricultural University. I have recently joined the ISElab (Laboratory of Intelligent Software Engineering) at the School of Software, Nanjing University.

My primary programming languages ​​are Python and C/C++. My long-term interests focus on Deep Learning, LLM, Agent systems. I have been conducting in-depth research on these technologies for the past few months. I look forward to sharing and exchanging more technical experiences with everyone
