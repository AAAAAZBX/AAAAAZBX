My name is Boxuan Zhang, and I am a senior undergraduate student at Nanjing Agricultural University. I have recently joined the ISElab (Laboratory of Intelligent Software Engineering) at the School of Software, Nanjing University.

My primary programming languages ​​are Python and C/C++. My long-term interests focus on deep learning, LLM, Agent systems, Operator development, Software testing, and HPC (High-Performance Computing). I have been conducting in-depth research on these technologies for the past few months.

I am passionate about technology, especially how Agent can improve productivity and solve real-world problems. I am eager to learn and hope to find my place in this rapidly evolving field. I look forward to sharing and exchanging more technical experiences with everyone
